This project is a playable browser simulation of the Pokemon Cystal battle engine.

This uses [modular Pokemon Showdown](https://github.com/pkmn/ps) as the backend.

The battle experience is mostly complete. Not all moves are finished and items aren't supported yet.

## Quick start ##

From the root directory, install all required packages:

```bash
npm install
```

### Battle demo ###

```bash
cd demo/menus
npm run dev
```

Visit `localhost:8001/menus.html` to play a battle.

### Animation demo ###

```bash
cd demo/moves
npm run dev
```

Visit `localhost:8000/moves.html` to try out move animations.
